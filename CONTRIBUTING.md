# How to Contribute

## Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. We're striving to make Zumito an inclusive environment that's great for first time open-source contributors.

tldr; we value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.

## Pull Requests

Zumito use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork the Zumito repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests and commits SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
